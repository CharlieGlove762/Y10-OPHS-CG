#This is a comment
#Variables Vs Constants
#Variables are declared in titlecase
#CONSTANTS are declared in CAPITALS

#Examples of variables

Team1name =("Olise's ones")
Team2name =("Eze's eleven")

#Variables have a useful name
#Variables store a value (can change)
#variables can NOT start with a number
#e.g. 1TeamName = "Eze's eleven"
#This will cause a syntax error

#Variables cannot have a space in the name
#e.g. Team Name = "Eze's eleven"
#This will be a syntax error

#This is am example of a CONSTANT
FREETHROW = 1
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER = 3

#The values is a CONSTANT do NOT change
